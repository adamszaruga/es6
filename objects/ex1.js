let one = 1;
let two = 2;
let three = 3;

// Coalesce the above variables into a single object


//Pamela
let obj = { one, two, three, four, five}



// Ron's Code no peeking did not pay attention whoops

let obj = {
     one,
     two,
     three                 
}
// end Ron's answer 


//Jeff's Code

let myObj = { one, two, three, four, five };



// jordan saints got robbed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

let obj = {one, two, three, four, five};
